## Task description ##

Analyze solutions [Transformer IEEE754](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/transformer-ieee754) and [Transformer in words](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/transformer-to-words) in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of transformation the number according some rule?    
Propose various ways to solve this problem. **Do not use LINQ queries and delegates**.   
Demonstrate using this solution with two different rule of the number (see task conditions above) using them when developing tests.   
Add unit and moq-tests.   
Add XML-comments to public members of the solution.
